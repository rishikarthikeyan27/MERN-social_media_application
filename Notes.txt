The payload is the part of 
transmitted data that is the actual intended message. 
Headers and metadata are sent only to enable payload delivery.

jwt.verify(token, jwtSecret) ---->
Returns the payload decoded if the signature is valid and 
optional expiration, audience, or issuer are valid. If not, it will throw the error.

The beauty of software systems is that storing, retrieving information is the single most important and fundamental thing they do.
That is why we need to put in such massive amounts of effort into building the backend..

REMEMBER how router.get('/', auth, (req,res)=> {}) happens, this is because firstly we want auth to run first when the route is entered
after that is executed we can run our normal callback function that takes in req and res objects. Hence the name "Middleware"

# By the way 'auth' here is a function

You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. 
The only exception is that these callbacks might invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callbacks. 
You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions on a route, 
then pass control to subsequent routes if thereâ€™s no reason to proceed with the current route.
